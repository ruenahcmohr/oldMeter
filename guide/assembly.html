<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><br>
o&nbsp; <big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Gather the parts:</span></big><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;I have all the files on github
at&nbsp; https://github.com/ruenahcmohr/oldMeter . If something is
missing, find me and tell me!<br>
</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 512px; height: 384px;" alt="" src="p1290429.jpg"><img style="width: 512px; height: 384px;" alt="" src="p1290445.jpg"><br>
<br>
</div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">c 3d printed parts:</span><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">At the time of writing this, there are 12 3d printed parts. <br>
The back support plate for the needle scale has two options. There is a
normal version, and a steampunk version. The steampunk version is
cooler, so its what I will be using for the tutorial.<br>
<br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">backface-r2-s.stl(normal version)&nbsp; or&nbsp; backfaceB-r1-s.stl (steampunk version)<br>
motorFrame-r4-s.stl<br>
pinsupport-r3-s.stl<br>
pulley-r6-s.stl<br>
tube-r2-s.stl<br>
adapterFlange-r4-s.stl<br>
potBracket-r2-s.stl<br>
pulley2-r2-s.stl<br>
backcap-r3-s.stl<br>
face-r8-s.stl<br>
needleHub-r3-s.stl<br>
trimLock-r1-s.stl<br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The -r* is my version number for the
part, if you see two of the same part, use the one with the later
version number. These were all just printed in PLA, no support.<br>
</div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">c CNC cut parts:</span><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">There are two parts that I made with a
CNC machine, if you don't have a cnc machine, (many of us don't) please
figure something out. I would be happy to include (most) of the
solutions people come up with in the project as assembly options.<br>
<br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">pointer-3.nc<br>
window.nc<br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The window is cut from the case of a CD with a 3mm carbide bit at about 500RPM. You&nbsp; should be fine to use a 1.8" bit.<br>
<br>
The pointer was cut from the CD itself (not a rewriteable CD, the stuff flakes off) with a 1.5mm carbide bit at about 700 RPM<br>
The needle is trickey to cut. I think its easiest to use double sided
tape to hold it down to something sacraficial. Both the files will do a
moderate overcut of the material.<br>
The dxf contains the origional profiles if you want to re-cam the parts.<br>
</div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">c SG90 servo</span><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The project uses an SG90 servo, a normal one, not modified for 360 degrees.<br>
</div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">c Sewing pin</span><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Because their all the same, right? This kind of thing prevents these projects from just being 'assemble and play'. <br>
</div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">c Spring</span><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;The spring is out of my bin, I can't help you find one (it was the only one in my bin)<br>
The spring is about 11.5mm long and has a diameter of about 3.25mm<br>
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 512px; height: 384px;" alt="" src="p1290433.jpg"><img style="width: 512px; height: 384px;" alt="" src="p1290434.jpg"><br>
</div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">c Thread</span><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Any thread should do.<br>
</div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">c Screws</span><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Again, most of these screws are from my
junk bin. If you have taken apart an old cell phone, you should have
the small ones you need. One of them is modified.<br>
I did not include screws here to hold the parts into the main tube
body. If you want to you could either use (9x) M2 machine or plastic
screws, or use "rivets" made of 1.75mm filament.<br>
<br>
The screw list is:<br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp; 4x 4-40 countersunk screws, 1/2" long, and 4 nuts.<br>
&nbsp; 6x M2 screws, about 4mm long (here I have used a mix of machine
screws and screws for plastic. I recommend black screws for the face)<br>
&nbsp; 1x 6-32 brass screw. It does not have to be brass, thats just
for look, But you do need to modify it. Cut it to 24mm long, and file
the end so there is a flat in the middle narrow enough to fit into the
slot of the potentiometer. (Actually you can skip all that if your not
going to add the trim potentiometer)<br>
</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 512px; height: 384px;" alt="" src="p1290431.jpg"><br>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">c Potentiometer.</span><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">I used a super common potentiometer for
the trim adjust on this. Technically, you might not even need or want a
trim for your project. <br>
The potentiometer is a common RM065 type, I commonly use 10k for things like this.<br>
</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 220px; height: 220px;" alt="" src="RM065.jpg"><br>
</div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">c The scale. </span><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">I was not able to get printed stickers in time for this, so I just used my laser printer for the scale.<br>
If you open "scaleArt.svg" with inkscape, and have it get the size from the file, it should come out the right size.<br>
**be aware** that inkscape, by default prints at a HORRIFIC (low) DPI, make sure that in the options you set it to 600DPI<br>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 512px; height: 384px;" alt="" src="p1290445.jpg"><br>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">c Crazyglue</span><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">yup. I just use dollar store stuff
cause every a normal bottle is too expensive and its just going to all
sieze up after its opened.<br>
</div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">c Scale glue</span><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Some kinda glue for sticking the
background print to the plastic backing, I'm using some Elmers clear
glue. Try to find a glue that will not warp the paper, I'm using just a
thin layer of the glue I have here.<br>
</div>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><br>
<br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">o Prep the drive thread.</span></big><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The only way I have to show you the
length of this is to use my calipers. This is about the minimum length
you want it to be, It needs to be rather precise, I think you can get
away with it being 2mm shorter at most. I made this by tieing the
string to the end of the spring, and then giving it a *tiny* amount of
crazy glue to hold the knot. (warning, it takes forever to set)<br>
</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 512px; height: 384px;" alt="" src="p1290432.jpg"><br>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">o Prep the background scale</span></big><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">If your using the standard scale, cut to the outter lines, then punch holes were the circles are for screws.<br>

If you using the steampunk scale, carefully cut around the numbers (or whatever you modified it to ;]&nbsp; ) <br>
</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 512px; height: 384px;" alt="" src="p1290446.jpg"><img style="width: 512px; height: 384px;" alt="" src="p1290447.jpg"><br>
</div>
<br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">o Perp needle shaft pin.</span></big><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">I cut this pin to about 20.75mm long.<br>
</div>

<br>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 512px; height: 384px;" alt="" src="p1290451.jpg"><br>
</div>

<br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">o Start assembly - mount servo</span></big><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Ok lets start by mouting the servo to 'motorFrame' Its designed to just fit the screws that come with the servo.<br>
</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 512px; height: 384px;" alt="" src="p1290435.jpg"><br>
</div>
<br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">o Attach servo pulley</span></big><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The part is just called 'Pulley' it should friction fit onto the servo shaft. Its designed to work with the screw that comes with the servo.<br>
</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 517px; height: 384px;" alt="" src="p1290436.jpg"><br>
</div>
<br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">o Insert the modified pin.</span></big><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">If I forgot to go back and tell you what the modification was, I appologize now.<br>
This goes in from the servo side of the motorframe, it should be a bit loose.<br>
</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 512px; height: 384px;" alt="" src="p1290437.jpg"><br>
</div>
<br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">o Install the motor pulley</span></big><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">This is "Pulley2" it should be a bit tight on the pin. We will crazy glue that later.<br>
</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 512px; height: 384px;" alt="" src="p1290438.jpg"><br>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">o Install the drive thread.</span></big><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">This is an interesting process of
getting everything mostly on, then stretching it the last bit over
"Pulley2". The spring should sit lower than the lip on pulley2.<br>
Try to position the thread so that its against the back of one side of
"Pulley2" and the front edge of the opposite side of "Pulley2". The
idea is to keep the thread from rubbing on itself where it crosses.<br>
</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 512px; height: 384px;" alt="" src="p1290439.jpg"><img style="width: 512px; height: 384px;" alt="" src="p1290440.jpg"><br>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">o Install the hub into the needle.</span></big><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The pointer needle was done with a seperate hub to open up the build options a bit. (For now, its just an annoyance) <br>
Here I pre-inerted a needle thru the "NeedleHub" , then took it off,
and lightly pressed the hub into the cnc cut needle. This also gets
crazy glue to keep it all in place. (later)<br>
I took this opportunity to use a sharpie to colour my pointer.<br>
</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 512px; height: 384px;" alt="" src="p1290441.jpg"><br>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">o Install the pointer needle on the pin.</span></big><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">It should just slide on, you want to have it positioned just a *bit* behind the two adjacent posts.<br>
</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 512px; height: 384px;" alt="" src="p1290442.jpg"><br>
</div>
<br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">o Lock needle in place.</span></big><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Next (lightly!!) crazy glue both
"Pulley2" and the pointer needle to the pin. The needle should be
aligned to the middle of "Pulley2", you can usually move it a bit later
if you want.<br>
</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 512px; height: 384px;" alt="" src="p1290443.jpg"><br>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">o Glue the background scale on.</span></big><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The scale was designed to be used with the standard background "Backface", here, I'm using the steampunk version "BackfaceB"<br>
</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 512px; height: 384px;" alt="" src="p1290447.jpg"><img style="width: 512px; height: 384px;" alt="" src="p1290448.jpg"><img style="width: 512px; height: 384px;" alt="" src="p1290449.jpg"><br>
</div>
<br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">o Install front shaft support.</span></big><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">While the glue dries a bit from that
last step... This is part "Pinsupport". I used two of the 2mm screws
for plastic that I had. The pin should fit thru loose.<br>
Please note that the pin should not stick out that much, I cut mine
back after this. The "Pinsupport" should not rub the needle hub. I find
that the crazyglue does not stick well to the metal, so if you need to
make adjustments, its usually ok.<br>
</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 512px; height: 384px;" alt="" src="p1290450.jpg"><br>
</div>
<br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">o Install the scale</span></big><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">I found that my scale support
("BackfaceB") needed the holes a bit larger for my scerws. I think the
model is find and my printer was just having a bad day. so I enlarged
the holes with a small screwdriver. Its screwed to the two supports
with M2 machine screws.<br>
</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 512px; height: 384px;" alt="" src="p1290452.jpg"><img style="width: 512px; height: 384px;" alt="" src="p1290455.jpg"><br>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">o Install the needle trim potentiometer.</span></big><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">This is an electronic trim, its
optional. The round edge of "PotBracket" should be on the side of the
pot with two pins. I'm just using the tap and one end of the
potentiometer, you can bring out all 3 leads if you want. The idea is
to use this to adjust a small offset in the needle position to match
the printed scale. This is mounted with two 2mm screws for plastic.<br>
</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 512px; height: 384px;" alt="" src="p1290456.jpg"><img style="width: 512px; height: 384px;" alt="" src="p1290457.jpg"><br>
</div>
<br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">o Assemble the faceplate.</span></big><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">This is parts "Face", "AdapterFlange" and the CNC cut "window". Its screwed togethor with the 4 countersunk 4-40 screws. <br>
</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 512px; height: 384px;" alt="" src="p1290458.jpg"><img style="width: 512px; height: 384px;" alt="" src="p1290459.jpg"><br>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">o Install core into the body tube.</span></big><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">*gently* (The layer ripples dont help,
maybe these should be printed with prime number based layer heights..)
slide the motorframe into the tube. The front of the tube has two close
rows of holes on it. Slide it in until the holes in "Motorframe" match
the holes in the tube. These holes were designed to fit 1.75mm
filament, As, of yet, I have never 'permanently' assembled on of these
meters, so if you come up with something else (2mm screws should work?)
do tell me!<br>
For now, to hold things in place, you can insert some bits of 1.75mm filament. (try not to loose them in there)<br>
</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 512px; height: 384px;" alt="" src="p1290460.jpg"><br>
</div>
<br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">o Install trim screw.</span></big><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">So even if you didn't install a potentiometer, you probably want to have a screw to fill the hole in the face.<br>
The screw is held in place with "trimLock" but its a bit tight. I had
to hold "TrimLock" with needle nose pliers and thread the screw into
it. The lock should not be tight, you want to be able to turn the scerw
easily. I put a small dab of glue (not the crazy glue) on there to help
hold it.<br>
</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 512px; height: 384px;" alt="" src="p1290461.jpg"><img style="width: 512px; height: 384px;" alt="" src="p1290462.jpg"><br>
</div>
<br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">o Install the face.</span></big><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">If you have ever worked on an old
meter, you probably know what a pain trying to align the needle trim
system can be like when re-assembling the meter.<br>
If you have not, I suppose your about to learn. <br>
The flat part of the screw should fit into the larger slot of the
potentiometer. Guess the right position, try to assemble it while
wiggling the screw, eventually it should all fit together.<br>
When its all assembled right, the holes in the side should all line up.<br>
</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 512px; height: 384px;" alt="" src="p1290464.jpg"><img style="width: 512px; height: 384px;" alt="" src="p1290465.jpg"><br>
</div>
<br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">o Install backplate</span></big><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The last step is to install the
backplate, the connector on the servo is a tight fit, it was meant to
fit the servo connector exactly. I'm just dumping all the wires thru
for now.<br>
</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 512px; height: 384px;" alt="" src="p1290466.jpg"><br>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">o Abrupt tutorial end.</span></big><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">This is the part where you need the tutorial to tell you something else, but the author didn't think of it.<br>
Enjoy, bye!<br>
